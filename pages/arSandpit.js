          Our team has developed a cool real-time integrated augmented reality
          sandpit to physically create topography models which are then scanned
          into a computer in real-time, and used as background for a variety of
          graphics effects and simulations. We have used the Kinect v2 for
          calculation of the depth and a projector to project the real-time
          simulation over the sand which is processed by the computer software.

          The AR Sandpit helps the students to learn about geographic, geologic
          concepts such as how to read a topography map, water simulation, the
          meaning of contour lines, catchment areas watersheds, and more in an
          interactive way.

          The interactive sandpit idea was initially brought to light by a team
          of scientists at The UC-Davis (https://arsandbox.ucdavis.edu/ ). They
          first developed a Linux-based software with limitations of their time
          and technology. We have developed a more stabilized, most responsive
          and accurate model.
